## Model standing — read this first

Fitting the optimal blend between this model's projections and the no-vig market price, over the real graded record, returns a weight on the **market** of:

| Board | n | Model Brier | Market Brier | Optimal weight on market |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NRFI forced calls | 200 | 0.2686 | **0.2459** | **1.00** |
| Props — tier A | 279 | 0.2568 | **0.2489** | 0.80 |
| Props — tier B | 2,224 | 0.2507 | **0.2436** | **1.00** |
| Props — tier C | 4,450 | 0.2281 | **0.2231** | **1.00** |

**Predictions are most accurate when this model's number is discarded and the market price is used instead.** The projections are not merely uninformative — including them makes forecasts measurably worse. Tier A props retain a 0.20 weight, and even there the blended Brier (0.2485) beats the pure market (0.2489) by an amount inside the noise.

Consequences now built into the model: qualification gates run on the market-shrunk probability, so a row must show edge AFTER its projection is pulled toward the price; NRFI confidence tiers were retired as a signal after measuring as anti-predictive (High tier 45.0% actual vs 63.7% claimed, Coin flip 58.8% vs 53.0%); and the HR board carries a fitted calibration scale after projecting 24.5% and delivering 14.7% over 150 graded rows.

**Gate mode: MODEL.** Recommendations are generated from the model's own edge and EV, not the market-shrunk figures above. Every row records both, so this period can be graded either way after the fact — if the model-gated picks win, the Brier result above was the wrong read and the record will say so plainly.

Track two numbers as this accumulates: whether gate-clearing picks beat their own stated probability, and whether they beat the closing price. The first says the model is calibrated; the second says it has edge. Neither has been shown yet.

**Hit rate vs predicted is the whole test.** A board that hits at the rate it claims is trustworthy even when it loses; a board that hits below its own number is telling you it does not know what it claims to know.

**Model A** = current model (control). **Model B** = retired variant, history preserved. CLV measured from the real price vs close. Each unique bet counted once. Paper only — no real money.

**Model A: 423-353  ·  55% win  ·  -9.29u  ·  -1.2% ROI  ·  avg CLV -2.81%**
**Model B: 237-191  ·  55% win  ·  +14.16u  ·  +3.3% ROI  ·  avg CLV n/a (no closing lines yet)**

## Board calibration standings

These boards are calibration records, not bets. The question is not whether they won — it is whether a call at a stated confidence lands at that rate. A tier that hits BELOW its stated probability is a model telling you it does not know what it claims to know.

### NRFI/YRFI forced calls

| Confidence | n | Hit | Miss | Hit% | Model said | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | 257 | 132 | 125 | 51% | 63% | -12% |
| Medium | 94 | 51 | 43 | 54% | 56% | -2% |
| Low | 46 | 20 | 26 | 43% | 54% | -10% |
| Coin flip | 86 | 47 | 39 | 55% | 53% | +1% |
| **All** | **483** | **250** | **233** | **52%** | **59%** | **-7%** |

YRFI share of calls: **304/483 (63%)** — hitting 51%.

**Naive baseline check.** First innings were scoreless in **50.9%** of these games, so always calling NRFI scores **50.9%**. The model scores **51.8%**.

> ⚠️ **Confidence is inverted**: the High tier is hitting BELOW the Coin flip tier. Whatever the confidence metric is measuring, it is not the probability of being right. Calls at this tier should carry no weight until this reverses.

> **Sample-size reality check.** Distinguishing a real edge from noise needs hundreds of graded calls per tier. Gaps below are indicative, not verdicts — except where a tier is inverted against a lower tier, which is a structural signal rather than variance.

## Gate comparison — model vs market-shrunk

| Market-shrunk | 0 | — |

> **135 totals excluded** from every table below: they were locked against a probable ALTERNATE line before the main-line fix of 2026-08-25, so both the pick and its grade were made against a number the book never offered. They are kept in the ledger and flagged, not deleted.

## Weak-link analysis

Every slice of the graded record with a bootstrap confidence interval. A segment only counts as a demonstrated loser when its whole interval sits below zero — otherwise it is a segment having a bad run, and cutting it would be fitting to noise.

### By model score — does the score rank bets correctly?

| Score band | n | Record | Units | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.0–5.9 | 147 | 71-76 | -14.59u | -9.9% |
| 6.0–6.9 | 108 | 52-56 | -9.34u | -8.6% |
| 7.0–7.9 | 123 | 64-59 | -2.17u | -1.8% |
| 8.0–8.9 | 100 | 65-35 | +15.80u | +15.8% |
| 9.0–10.9 | 234 | 134-100 | -6.19u | -2.6% |

> Rank correlation between score band and ROI: **+0.70** (+1.00 = ROI rises perfectly with score).

> Below score 7.0: **-23.93u over 255 bets (-9.4%)**. At 7.0 and above: **+7.44u over 457 bets (+1.6%)**. The sign flips at exactly the PLAY threshold.

> ⚠️ ROI does not trend with score. The score is not reliably ranking bets, and any threshold drawn from this table would be fitted to noise.

> 70 picks were locked on a LATE core run (the midnight slot was dropped and the work was done hours later). They count in the W-L record but are excluded from CLV below, because a pick taken at noon cannot be compared to a closing line the same way one taken at midnight can.

### Closing line value — the deeper test

Across **64** picks with a captured close, average CLV is **-3.21%** and **17/64 (27%)** beat the closing price.

> ⚠️ **Negative CLV outweighs a winning record.** The market is moving against these picks after they lock, which is what luck looks like from the inside — a model with real edge gets better prices than the close, not worse. Until this turns positive, treat any winning stretch as variance.

> One measurement caveat before over-reading it: picks lock at the BEST price across two books, and the close is captured from that same book. Some of the gap is simply the best-of-two price regressing, not the market disagreeing. The honest read is directional, not exact.

## Early vs late pull

> **CLV caveat.** Beating the close is evidence of skill only when the move came from the market re-evaluating information we also had. If a scratch or injury broke after we locked, we collect the CLV without having known anything — that is luck wearing the costume of skill. Read CLV in aggregate, never on a single bet.

> CLV is the signal that matters here, not W-L — per the sharp-bettor method, beating the closing line is what indicates a real edge. A small sample of wins with negative CLV is luck, not edge.

### Moneyline probability calibration (Model A, n=431)

Brier score: **0.2407** (0.25 = coin flip knowledge; lower is better)

| Model home-win band | n | Predicted avg | Actual home-win % |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0%–40% | 56 | 35% | 34% |
| 40%–45% | 72 | 43% | 46% |
| 45%–50% | 70 | 47% | 40% |
| 50%–55% | 57 | 52% | 49% |
| 55%–60% | 77 | 57% | 64% |
| 60%–65% | 53 | 62% | 58% |
| 65%+ | 46 | 69% | 67% |

> Calibrated = predicted ≈ actual per band. Systematic gaps mean the win probabilities themselves need retuning before any ML edge claim.
